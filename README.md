# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-and-Preprocessing-of-the-Iris-Dataset-for-Machine-Learning

The project involved exploring and preprocessing the Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples and 5 columns: four numeric features—sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, petal_width—and one categorical feature, species. Initial data exploration used histograms with 20 bins and pairplots to understand feature distributions and relationships, revealing a strong positive correlation of approximately 0.96 between petal_length and petal_width, and a moderate correlation of about 0.87 between sepal_length and petal_length. No missing values were detected, but a mean-imputation method was implemented for robustness in case of missing numeric data. Categorical encoding was performed using one-hot encoding (resulting in 3 binary columns) and label encoding, where the species were numerically labeled as Setosa = 0, Versicolor = 1, and Virginica = 2. Visualizations such as violin plots demonstrated distinct distribution patterns of sepal_length across the three species. The processed dataset is now clean, fully encoded, and structurally prepared for subsequent machine learning modeling tasks, with important feature correlations identified to guide feature selection.
